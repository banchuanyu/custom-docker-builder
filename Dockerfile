# This image expects a set of environment variables to parameterize the build:
#
#   OUTPUT_REGISTRY - the Docker registry URL to push this image to
#   VERSION - the version of image to be built
#   BASE_IMAGE_NAME - the name of the base image 
#   OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACES - the reposistory name of the image to be built
#   SOURCE_REPOSITORY - a URI to fetch the build context from
#   SOURCE_REF - a reference to pass to Git for which commit to use (optional)
#
# This image expects to have the Docker socket bind-mounted into the container.
# If "/root/.dockercfg" is bind mounted in, it will use that as authorization
# to a Docker registry.
